# GradleCopy
is a tool to copy Gradle cashes to Android local "m2repository" directory which saves me from redownload (`Qt` based)

**Platform:** broken `Windows` but should also work for `Mac` and `Linux`

**Note:**
All codes are based and meant to be MIT License but it does use LGPL framework so if you rewrite this using another framework it is MIT License
